<h3 class="mt-2">Chapter 3</h3>
<p>In the midst of a war, an elf and an elder dragon broke the sacred rule and had a baby. They named the baby Lydia. The couple was cursed and kicked out of their countries. They went to seek refuge at a noble gambler’s house. The gambler’s name was Lloyd and agreed to let them stay if their parents became Lloyd’s slave. They worked there for years while taking care of Lydia. 20 years later, Lydia went to school in the prestigious Grassland Academy which is built on top of the legendary tree Yggdrasil.</p> 
<p>In the school, Lydia was bullied and teased as she thought she was a gambler when she clearly was a hybrid of elf and dragon. After she came home, she would always cry and regretted even being born. One day, Lydia bumped into the king’s son, Kyle. Kyle was mad and he demanded a ??????????. Kyle saw that Lydia was wearing a beautiful necklace. Kyle said that he would forgive Lydia if she gave Kyle her necklace.Lydia refused, saying my parents gave me this necklace, you’ll never have it.</p> <p>That made Kyle furious, as he replied saying if you won’t give me the necklace, I’ll just take it by force. Kyle is extremely arrogant as he is powerful. He threw Lydia to the ground and used an artifact dice. The artifact dice rolled and got a fire symbol. Soon, Kyle’s body went up in flames and he burned Lydia. Lydia was coughing blood when suddenly, a branch of Yggdrasil protected Lydia and smacked Kyle until he was unconscious.</p>
<p>After school, Lydia asked her parents why the tree protected her. Their parents then explained about her being a dragon and elf’s daughter and Lydia was shocked. The next few days passed along peacefully until an elder dragon breached into the gambler’s nation and attacked the school.</p> 
<p>The elder dragon wanted to challenge Lydia’s father to a duel to prove that he is stronger.The dragon spotted Lydia and picked her up. The dragon threatened that if she wanted to live, she should tell the dragon her father’s location. Lydia struggled to get out but the dragon squeezed even harder that it damaged Lydia’s ribs. She screamed so loud but no one dared to rescue her. Suddenly, her body glowed and she became a Dragonoid. At this moment, her parents both died. Lydia fought the dragon with her Dragonoid form and broke the dragon’s fang. The dragon smacked Lydia with his power packed tail and knocked Lydia unconscious. The dragon then escaped back to his homeland.</p> 
<p>Lydia mourned her parents’ death, she blamed herself for it. She vowed to stop the war and attain peace. 
A few months later, the mysterious stone in Kvaxiri cavern was taken by the king of humans, Dmitri. Dmitri later found out that he had the melting stone. Dmitri kept the stone research top secret. Lydia heard the news and thought of a way to stop the war. She would destroy the mysterious stones.</p> 
<p>To destroy the mysterious stones, she needed to know more about the mysterious stones, so she began to research. After 2 weeks of research, she found nothing. When she was about to give up, an upperclassmen student told Lydia, I see you’re very interested in the mysterious stones. Lydia responded yes and the student introduced herself to Lydia. I’m Atila. I would like to thank you for saving my brother-in-law's life from the dragon a few months ago. He was in a wheelchair so it was hard for him to escape. Lydia explained her situation and how she wanted to stop the war. Atila was very intrigued and replied, i will help you. I come from a long line of assassins, I can sneak into anywhere at any time. I will find out what the king’s stone is. If I’m caught, I won’t rat you out, don’t worry. Soon, Atila began her plan.</p>
