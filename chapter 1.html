<p>Once upon a time, there was peace and equality in the Unvitalia universe. All creatures lived harmoniously, co-existing with one another. However, that was all in the past after the mysterious stones were found. 200 years after the humans won the Battle of Mysterious Stones, their population grew so fast that they became the strongest and the most ruthless of the five creatures. The humans would destroy, enslave or kill all other magical creatures.</p>
<p>In that world of human domination, demons, dragons, elves, gamblers and banished humans had to live in secrecy. A male demon named Ryuu Akemi went to a school hidden from humans. In this school, all other creatures and banished humans sought refuge. In school, Ryuu Akemi was teased and made fun of because of his small stature. All magical creatures in the Unvitalia universe had a sixth sense that enabled them to roughly estimate others’ magical power. This would provide a prediction of how a fight between two creatures would end. Ryuu’s classmates’ sixth sense told them that they would have destroyed Ryuu ruthlessly in a fight. However, Ryuu paid no attention to that, knowing fully what he was capable of. Whenever his classmates threw insults at him, he would just scoff at them and said, “Don’t even think about fighting me. You will never survive.” His glare would then envelope them with a sudden burst of extreme fear.</p>
<p>One morning, as he was walking along the lawn of the school, stepping on yellow maple leaves, his eyes caught a Dragonoid named Xander beating up a young banished human. 
“Please, save me,” cried the young child. Tears were flowing out of the child’s black eyes.
“Just die, you banished humans are as bad as the other humans. You trample on us magical beings like we’re trash,” Xander shouted angrily while delivering another punch to the child’s stomach.
Ryuu Akemi kicked a stone to Xander’s head and said, “Fight someone your own size, you punk. You are blessed with power, yet you only abuse it. Your attacks are wasting your power. You attack people weaker than you but don’t even dare to stand near people stronger than you. You praise others but stab them in the back when you have no more use for them. You’re less than scum, you trash.”</p>
<p>Xander then threw the child to the ground. He enlarged his size and flew to the training ground. Ryuu sprouted black wings and flew to the training ground alongside Xander. Xander completed his transformation and became a dragon. Xander loudly roared, “I WILL DESTROY YOU!!!”
Ryuu calmly replied, “I’d like to see you try.”
Ryuu’s remark only enraged Xander even more. </p>
<p>Xander shot dragon pulses from his mouth. Ryuu easily dodged them.
Ryuu formed a black sword made out of shadow and stabbed Xander in the stomach. The attack did not bother Xander and he continued attacking Ryuu. He tried to crush Ryuu with his gigantic claw but Ryuu easily blocked the attack by creating a shadow shield.
Xander tsked and said, ”That’s why I hate demons. Your attacks are extremely annoying.”
Ryuu chuckled and said, “It’s not my fault that you’re weak.”  
Hearing this, Xander was furious and about to use a secret skill that would blow himself up and incinerate the opponent. This technique was dangerous because it would harm the user’s own body. However, before Xander managed to launch the explosion, hundreds of black shadow swords pierced his body and no one even saw how the black sword pierced Xander. Xander lost a lot of blood and fell to the ground. </p>
<p>At that moment, a student named Einer quietly smirked and said, “It seems we have an interesting person in our midst.”
After that, Ryuu Akemi became known as the speed demon who defeated Xander. Everyone feared and respected Ryuu Akemi.
The next few days passed peacefully for Ryuu Akemi until the “Queen” asked Ryuu Akemi to join “the Monarchs”. She explained that the school has a student-led hierarchy-based group. The group was called “the Monarchs” which managed and ruled the school. The hierarchy was in the following order: King (Einer), Queen (Xyra), Jack (Zwerin), Prince (Xander), Princess (Lexi), Joker (Zane) and Ace (Clara). She also explained that  someone can replace or challenge a royal for their spot. Xyra wanted to replace Xander with Ryuu Akemi. In terms of strength they were currently arranged in the following order: Joker, Ace, Jack, King, Queen, Princess and lastly, Prince. Ryuu Akemi was about to decline until he heard that Zane was the Joker. Hearing this, Ryuu accepted the offer. 
The monarchs had a celebration to welcome Ryuu. Every monarch except Joker and the Princess came. At the end of the party, Zwerin, a young, red-haired gambler with a devilish look asked Ryuu to pick a weapon as his joining gift.</p> 
<p>Ryuu picked a sword and placed it in his dimensional ring. A dimensional ring is the opening to a storage space in the 4th dimension. The price of dimensional rings vary with the storage space and they range from 1,000 to 100,000 geos - the equivalent of 900 to 90,000 dollars. </p>
<p>Minutes later, Ryuu’s ring exploded and the sword dropped onto the floor. 
“Oh nooooo, my ringgg!” Ryuu cried in devastation, seeing his 88,000 geos ring explode into dust.
 When he picked up the sword, a black diamond-shaped marking appeared on Ryuu’s hands. All the monarchs were perplexed, as this had never happened before. 
Ryuu then visited Professor Eduardo in the science lab that belonged to him. Professor Eduardo was a world renowned professor who taught science in the school. </p>
<p>As the professor examined the marking, his face turned serious and solemn. ”Where did you get this from?” asked Professor Eduardo.
Ryuu replied,”I got it when I touched a beautiful golden sword I received during my initiation to the Monarchs. The blade of the sword is embedded with jewels and there are 9 holes on the guard.”
The professor asked Ryuu to bring the sword. As he examined the sword, his face turned pale and he shakily said, “This sword belonged to Lydia. It appears that you touching this brought forth a connection.”</p>
<p>Ryuu confuzzledly replied, “Who’s Lydia?”
The professor had a scared look on his face as if he was hiding a secret. He then replied, ”Once upon a time, there was a hybrid of elf and dragon named Lydia. Lydia destroyed cities and hoped to stop the war. In the end, she won the “Great Battle”. But suddenly, she disappeared and let the humans take Lydia’s victory.”
Ryuu then thanked Professor Eduardo and left the room. </p>
<p>Ryuu Akemi researched on who Lydia was in the school backyard with his computer. However, he could not find any information. He then gave up and started heading back to his dorm. On his way, he met Clara, a purple-haired banished human with a carefree look. She had eyes filled with scepticism and calculation, the result of the countless battles she had fought.
“What’s up with that depressed look, loser?” asked Clara.
Ryuu replied, ”Nothing, just trying to find out what these markings mean.”</p>
<p>Clara held Ryuu’s hands and ran her fingers on the black diamond-shaped marking. She had a shocked expression and teleported them to the attic of the school, The attic was Clara’s hideout. Clara’s eyes turned magenta and before Ryuu could react, Clara drew out a small dagger with the engraving written Soul Dimension and cut through Ryuu’s and her palm lines with it.
Clara swiped away a tear from her eyes and placed the teardrop in a glass that has BOND  written on it. Clara connected their palms and let their blood drip to the glass with writing on it. The liquid disappeared and Clara sighed. A slither of black shadow appeared at Ryuu’s wound. After a few seconds, it dissipated and the wound was gone. </p>
<p>After the wound healed, Ryuu stood up and pointed a sword at Clara’s neck. He asked angrily, “What did you do? Are you a threat?”
Clara calmly replied, “Wow, your healing skills are no joke. But mine sucks.” She then slowly inched forward, allowing Ryuu’s sword to cut her neck. As blood started to drip out of her neck, she retreated. Suddenly, Ryuu’s neck began dripping out blood. He tried to heal it but to no avail.</p>
<p>Clara smirked and answered, “What you feel, I feel. What you think of, I think of. I die,  YOU DIE,” and she laughed loudly.
Ryuu asked her why she did this and she teasingly said back, “You dumbass, your markings are from the legendary creature, Lydia. I want to find out what your connection is with her. I did this so you can’t do a single thing to me. So, should we team up, I’m sure I could be of use to you.” 
Ryuu thought,”It’s like making a deal with the devil.”</p>
