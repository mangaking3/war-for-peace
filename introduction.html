<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Once upon a time when the five nations of gamblers, demons, humans, dragons and elves lived not so harmoniously, a hybrid creature called Lydia discovered something that ended the war. The tale began many decades ago.</p>
<p>The demons are the most powerful because of their numbers, brute strength and defence. They serve their king, Satan, and if they drink Satan’s blood, they grow stronger. They specialize in darkness and boost magic.</p>
<p>Following them in second place are the dragons. The dragons can fly and have the ability to blow fire. They can switch between their human and dragon forms. Their human forms are called Dragonoids. The human form is a human-sized and human-like creature, but with a pair of horns and wings, as well as a tail. Their human forms exchange strength for flexibility. Their dragon forms are gigantic and are about the size of a few skyscrapers. The leaders of the dragon tribe are known as the 12 elders. The 12 elders’ dragon forms are a few times larger than normal dragons. The dragons specialize in fire and flight magic.</p>
<p>The third place belongs to the elves. They can control the abundant flora of the universe. They are also born with extreme amounts of magical energy called “mana” that allow them to perform magic. They are also natural healers. Some of them have an ability called Long Sense which endows them with sharpened senses, thus making it hard for enemies to hide. About 30% of the society is in illegal business that is ruled and protected by the 7 demon elves. The 7 demon elves control all trades and exchanges of Dazar powder that can suck another creature’s life energy to prolong one’s life or empower one’s magic. The government is aware of the 7 demon elves but is too afraid to take action because of their physical strength and connection to other powerful illegal business communities. The government makes a pact with the 7 demon elves – in return for the government allowing them to conduct their businesses, the demon elves would not cause havoc.  The elves specialize in basic magic – the magic of controlling basic elements. </p>
<p>In fourth rank are the gamblers, most of whom are born with a special die that can only be rolled by the owner. If the die is destroyed, their body turns to dust. Their magic is as such: when they roll the die, their strength will increase by the amount shown in the die. In rare cases, some gamblers can be born with a few dice and in even rarer cases, they can have dice with numbers up to 20. Some gamblers are born with an artifact dice. The artifact dice let the gambler use powers that are usually impossible for other gamblers to use. Instead of pips, the artifact dice could have symbols or elements. The user would be able to control the element that the dice landed on for a period of time. The symbol, on the other hand, would allow the user to acquire permanent power. For example, if the die landed on a feather symbol, a few feathers would emerge out of the user’s upper back. The user could roll it enough to make wings. However, users of artifact dice could only roll the die once every hour. The elements and symbols of every die were different. Gamblers specialize in luck, illusion and speed magic.</p>
<p>The weakest species is the humans which are highly intellectual, enabling them to slowly learn magic and create weapons. They are the only species not born with mana or special abilities, but their population is growing rapidly due to the need to compensate for their lack of power with a large army.</p>
<p>The basic elements are fire, earth, water, shadow, ice, lightning and wind. There is a special element called the Hidden Element. Only a handful can use the Hidden Element. It is a special category of elements that some creatures are naturally born with. There is not much known about the hidden element. Some known hidden elements are the ability to shoot sound waves and teleport. The most recently discovered information about the hidden element is that there is a connection between those able to use the hidden element and the Kvaxiri Cavern. The humans have the most probability of being able to use the Hidden Element. </p>
  <p>The five nations are fighting a war for the 9 Mysterious Stones. A stone was sighted deep in the Kvaxiri cavern. Each stone contains a special power and is hard to use and control. The only known stones are the elemental stone, which allows you to use all magic spells (even the hidden element) known to you as long as you are touching the stone, and the death stone, a stone able to kill anybody within a 500 m range. It can only be used once every new owner.</p>
<p>Kvaxiri cavern is an extremely dangerous cavern that is filled with spikes and bubbles. There are two kinds of bubbles in the cavern, death bubbles and life bubbles. The death bubbles cannot be popped as they will kill anyone who pops them. But hidden among the death bubbles are life bubbles that have to be popped, otherwise you will die. If the life bubbles are popped because of the spikes and not you, your whole team will die.</p>
