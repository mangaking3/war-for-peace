<p>Ryuu thought long and hard and finally came to a decision. 
“Fine. But you have to help me achieve all my goals. I want to understand this marking, find out the mystery behind this sword and kill Joker.” Ryuu told Clara. 
Clara slyly replied, ”Sure, but I have one problem. I won’t help you kill Joker.”</p>
<p>Ryuu arrogantly sneered, “Unfortunately, it’s not a choice, but an order. I’ll accept your proposal if you tell me why.” 
Clara sighed and replied, “In the past, I was a test subject for humans. I was a warrior elf captured and experimented on. My body overflowed with mana and the humans wanted that. They would cut up my body and reconnect it to different creatures.” She wiped tears that flowed out of her eyes.</p> 
<p>Clara continued, “They sucked my mana and placed it in the king. I was sucked dry and they were about to kill me when Joker came to save me. He then brought me to this school. However, people hated and envied me. They would shoot looks and whisper that the only reason I’m in this school is because of Joker, thousands and thousands of recruits stronger than her could have gotten in this school. I was misunderstood since day one and no one bothered to listen to me,” said Clara, now crying hysterically.<p>
    </p>Ryuu’s anger dissipated from his eyes slightly. He began to feel some empathy for Clara as he once experienced the same thing.
Clara wiped her tears and resumed her story, “I trained hard so that no one would judge me. A few months later, there was an announcement that there were potions, called soul potions, that could forcefully insert mythical spirits into your body. They cost at least 50 million geos. Two weeks after the announcement, the souls of a memory pixie and a plasma phoenix were infused into a soul potion. I wanted to steal it to revive my power. I was thinking of how to steal it when I found a stone that would make me invisible. It was a game changer that allowed me to devise a new plan.” </p>
<p>Clara paused, taking a deep breath and looked outside the window.
For a few seconds, both of them sat in silence. While Clara composed herself and retrieved the dark memory from her past, Ryuu waited patiently.</p>
<p>“I would use my magic to turn into a human to enter the auction room for the potion. When the potion is given to the new owner, I would steal it. I went to the auction room and my heart was pounding so loud. I waited for the potion’s turn to be auctioned and patiently watched as people set prices on it. The potion’s bid went to 300 million geos when the prince of the human country, Brock, bade 450 million geos. Everyone was shocked and Brock won the bid.</p> <p>As the potion was being handed to Brock, a group of bandits who called themselves the Warrior Slayers stole the potion. The bandits were diguised as the chairs Brock and his bodyguards was sitting on.</p>
<p>Their leader was immediately killed by Princess Euphimea, a princess who lives with the common folk, hoping for the public to help out others. I was shocked and unable to move, their leader was a 78.000 geos bounty man and he was killed in a single blow. I mustered up and stole it. I got my face seen as I dropped the rock and was shot by Brock’s bodyguards. I could barely move and i was about to kill myself when i witnessed a horrible truth. The truth helped me escape and I manipulated everyone’s memories and here I am now.”</p>
 
In a few seconds, Ryuu began flying and he crashed into the science lab. When he came closer to a dimensional ring, his markings glowed and he was sucked in the ring. 
In the ring he saw a humanoid-like creature who was trapped by chains. Ryuu Akemi broke the chains and noticed the humanoid-like creature was the legendary hybrid of elf and dragon, Lydia. Lydia began on a rampage and ran out of the school yelling "Kvaxiri Cavern. Kvaxiri Cavern was an old cavern that used to house a mysterious stone. Lydia was then bombarded with attacks by viceroy Euphemia of the human country. The viceroy tried to kill Lydia with his medusa powers. Lydia shone and light blades began stabbing the viceroy and the viceroy died. Lydia arrived at Kvaxiri Cavern. Ryuu Akemi saw Lydia staring at a maiden with beautiful golden hair. Lydia tried to revive her with one of the mysterious stones but to no avail. Lydia cried and shouted and after she calmed herself down, she explained her story to Ryuu Akemi.
