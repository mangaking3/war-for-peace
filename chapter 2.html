<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Ryuu thought long and hard and finally came to a decision. 
“Fine. But you have to help me achieve all my goals. I want to understand this marking, find out the mystery behind this sword and kill Joker.” Ryuu told Clara. 
Clara slyly replied, ”Sure, but I have one problem. I won’t help you kill Joker.”</p>
<p>Ryuu arrogantly sneered, “Unfortunately, it’s not a choice, but an order. I’ll accept your proposal if you tell me why.” 
Clara sighed and replied, “In the past, I was a test subject for humans. I was a warrior elf captured and experimented on. My body overflowed with mana and the humans wanted that. They would cut up my body and reconnect it to different creatures.” She wiped tears that flowed out of her eyes.</p> 
<p>Clara continued, “They sucked my mana and placed it in the king. I was sucked dry and they were about to kill me when Joker came to save me. He then brought me to this school. However, people hated and envied me. They would shoot looks and whisper that the only reason I’m in this school is because of Joker, thousands and thousands of recruits stronger than her could have gotten in this school. I was misunderstood since day one and no one bothered to listen to me,” said Clara, now crying hysterically.<p>
    </p>Ryuu’s anger dissipated from his eyes slightly. He began to feel some empathy for Clara as he once experienced the same thing.</p><p>Clara wiped her tears and resumed her story, “I trained hard so that no one would judge me. A few months later, there was an announcement that there were potions, called soul potions, that could forcefully insert mythical spirits into your body. They cost at least 50 million geos. Two weeks after the announcement, the souls of a memory pixie and a plasma phoenix were infused into a soul potion. I wanted to steal it to revive my power. I was thinking of how to steal it when I found a stone that would make me invisible whenever i touched it. It was a game changer that allowed me to devise a new plan.” 
Clara paused, taking a deep breath and looked outside the window.
For a few seconds, both of them sat in silence. While Clara composed herself and retrieved the dark memory from her past, Ryuu waited patiently.</p>
<p>“I would use my magic to turn into a human to enter the auction room for the potion. When the potion is given to the new owner, I would steal it. I went to the auction room and my heart was pounding so loud. I waited for the potion’s turn to be auctioned and patiently watched as people set prices on it. The potion’s bid went to 300 million geos when the prince of the human country, Brock, bade 450 million geos. Everyone was shocked and Brock won the bid. The auctioneer approached Brock at his seat to hand the potion to Brock. As Brock reached out his hands to receive the potion, the antique golden chair he was sitting on suddenly turned into a creature. The creature’s long and slim fingers, quick as light, grabbed the potion and immediately flashed out from the room. As he headed for the exit, he shouted ‘This will be mine and I will be one of the leaders of gamblers.’ He then let out a malicious laugh.”</p>
<p>Clara chuckled and said, ”He was so confident.” 
Ryuu looked at Clara curiously, waiting for her to continue.
Clara went on, “As he grabbed the door handle, he was shot in the stomach by Princess Euphimea. Princess Euphimea was a princess who lived with the common folk, hoping to change the people’s negative perceptions and hatred for the royals. I was shocked and unable to move. The gambler was a 78,000 geos bounty man and he was killed in a single blow, or so everyone thought. Everyone in the room cheered for Princess Euphimea for killing the thief. The people gathered around Princess Euphimea in the middle of the room and did not notice the gambler throwing a die which landed on a smoke symbol. The gambler then slowly turned to smoke and was about to disappear. But right before he did that, Princess Euphimea’s eyes caught his movement and she quickly shot 3 more bullets at the gambler, making the smoke dissipate. This time, it was confirmed that the gambler was dead.”</p>
<p>Ryuu said, “The princess sounds powerful.”
Clara replied, ”She is powerful indeed. After all my years of training, I still think that she would beat me in a fight.”
Clara continued on, “After that, guards were called by the auctioneer to protect the door so no one could see that Princess Euphimea killed a creature. Princess Euphimea seemed kind and caring to the public. But a secret that was only known by the elites of the country was that Princess Euphimea was cold blooded and ruthless. She would not have second thoughts about killing or making a creature her slave. As everyone was applauding Princess Euphimea once again, I went invisible and slowly took the potion from the gambler’s hands. I slowly opened the door. However, I accidentally dropped the rock and made myself visible. The guard protecting the door saw me and punched me in the stomach with his powerful fist. He shot me in the leg and I was screaming inside from the pain. I could barely move and was about to kill myself to spare myself from getting tortured. It was then when I received help that allowed me to escape. </p>
<p>“What and who was the help from?” Ryuu asked.
“I will not tell you now. But I may do so in the near future.” Clara replied, knowing this could get her killed.
Ryuu smiled and threateningly said, “I admire your bravery and will respect your decision, but I may change my mind and ask you once again. If you decline, there will be consequences. Now, continue your story.”
Clara slightly shivered but she hid that feeling by bravely saying,”You can’t hurt me, remember that.
Ryuu laughed and said, “The first mistake you made was that I can feel what you’re feeling. So I can also feel your fear. Your second mistake was that you thought I had no resistance to pain.”
Ryuu formed a sword and asked Clara to blink. The moment she blinked, cuts appeared all over Clara’s body. The same cuts at the same places slowly appeared on Ryuu’s body but he simply said, “I trained so hard in hell that cuts, broken bones, poison and other weak attacks would not bother me in the slightest.” </p>
<p>Clara touched the wounds and started healing them. She laughed and said, “Those don’t affect me either.” She confidently smiled but that smile turned to shock when none of the wounds were healing. She then began to shiver in fear. She realized that she had underestimated Ryuu. </p>
<p>Ryuu placed his right palm on one of the wounds in his left arm. Black shadows appeared, and started to cover both his and Clara’s wounds. In 5 seconds, the wounds were completely gone and the black shadows disappeared. As Clara was in awe of Ryuu’s power, a look of triumph and pride enveloped his face and he calmly said, “Now, now.” He shot a smile to Clara and raised his eyebrow, “Continue your story.”
Clara thought to herself, “I will not anger this man.” </p>
<p>She slowly continued her story, “After I escaped, I searched for a hiding spot in the school and found this attic. I stole pills from the pharmacy, took them and slept for 3 days without waking up. When I woke up, my head felt like it was exploding but luckily my wound was dry. Knowing that the potion’s power was too great for me, I wanted to expand my mana storage so that my body can accommodate that increase in power. Everyday for 7 months, I let my mana out profusely to let my body create an extra mana reservoir. For the next 5 months, I honed my battle skills and thought about how to add more power from the potion to my attacks. I spent the final 2 months thinking about who the new Clara should be. I planned my new identity and how she would act.”
“When I finally felt ready, I drank the potion and used the memory pixie’s power to manipulate everyone’s memory that I came to the school because I was talented and not because I had help. However, I could not manipulate the memories of people stronger than me. To mitigate that problem, I used a forbidden skill that put my soul in this child’s body so no one would recognize me. I fooled everyone except Joker. My acts and disguises did not work on him given his sharpness.”</p>
<p>Ryuu stretched his arms, cracked his neck and said, “Wow, what a long story, but now i know almost everything about your life. I will make use of that. Now tell me, where can I find information about Lydia.”
Clara said, “There are 2 places I could think of. Grassland Academy where Lydia studied or Baron Lloyd’s mansion where Lydia grew up. They are both in Prince Alaric’s region, Andorrea. It would take 13 days to walk there, but I have an aurora wolf that you can ride on. With it, it will only take 5 days.”
Ryuu replied with,”Thanks, but I can fly there in 2 days. Help me tell the teacher a good excuse for me to skip class.”</p>
